## Introduction

A **PBO** (Packed Bank of Objects) is DayZ's archive format -- the equivalent of a `.zip` file for game content. Every mod the game loads is delivered as one or more PBO files. When a player subscribes to a mod on Steam Workshop, they download PBOs. When a server loads mods, it reads PBOs. The PBO is the final deliverable of the entire modding pipeline.

Understanding how to create PBOs correctly -- when to binarize, how to set prefixes, how to structure the output, and how to automate the process -- is the last step between your source files and a working mod. This chapter covers everything from the basic concept through advanced automated build workflows.

## What is a PBO?

A PBO is a flat archive file that contains a directory tree of game assets. It has no compression (unlike ZIP) -- files inside are stored at their original size. The "packing" is purely organizational: many files become one file with an internal path structure.

### Key Characteristics

- **No compression:** Files are stored verbatim. The PBO's size equals the sum of its contents plus a small header.
- **Flat header:** A list of file entries with paths, sizes, and offsets.
- **Prefix metadata:** Each PBO declares an internal path prefix that maps its contents into the engine's virtual filesystem.
- **Read-only at runtime:** The engine reads from PBOs but never writes to them.
- **Signed for multiplayer:** PBOs can be signed with a Bohemia-style key pair for server signature verification.

### Why PBOs Instead of Loose Files

- **Distribution:** One file per mod component is simpler than thousands of loose files.
- **Integrity:** Key signing ensures the mod has not been tampered with.
- **Performance:** The engine's file I/O is optimized for reading from PBOs.
- **Organization:** The prefix system ensures no path collisions between mods.

---

## PBO Internal Structure

When you open a PBO (using a tool like PBO Manager or MikeroTools), you see a directory tree:

```
MyMod.pbo
  $PBOPREFIX$                    <-- Text file containing the prefix path
  config.bin                      <-- Binarized config.cpp (or config.cpp if -packonly)
  Scripts/
    3_Game/
      MyConstants.c
    4_World/
      MyManager.c
    5_Mission/
      MyUI.c
  data/
    models/
      my_item.p3d                 <-- Binarized ODOL (or MLOD if -packonly)
    textures/
      my_item_co.paa
      my_item_nohq.paa
      my_item_smdi.paa
    materials/
      my_item.rvmat
  sound/
    gunshot_01.ogg
  GUI/
    layouts/
      my_panel.layout
```

### $PBOPREFIX$

The `$PBOPREFIX$` file is a tiny text file at the root of the PBO that declares the mod's path prefix. For example:

```
MyMod
```

This tells the engine: "When something references `MyMod\data\textures\my_item_co.paa`, look inside this PBO at `data\textures\my_item_co.paa`."

### config.bin vs. config.cpp

- **config.bin:** Binarized (binary) version of config.cpp, created by Binarize. Faster to parse at load time.
- **config.cpp:** The original text-format configuration. Works in the engine but is slightly slower to parse.

When you build with binarization, config.cpp becomes config.bin. When you use `-packonly`, config.cpp is included as-is.

---

## AddonBuilder: The Packing Tool

**AddonBuilder** is Bohemia's official PBO packing tool, included with DayZ Tools. It can operate in GUI mode or command-line mode.

### GUI Mode

1. Launch AddonBuilder from DayZ Tools Launcher.
2. **Source directory:** Browse to your mod folder on P: (e.g., `P:\MyMod`).
3. **Output directory:** Browse to your output folder (e.g., `P:\output`).
4. **Options:**
   - **Binarize:** Check to run Binarize on content (converts P3D, textures, configs).
   - **Sign:** Check and select a key to sign the PBO.
   - **Prefix:** Enter the mod prefix (e.g., `MyMod`).
5. Click **Pack**.

### Command-Line Mode

Command-line mode is preferred for automated builds:

```bash
AddonBuilder.exe [source_path] [output_path] [options]
```

**Full example:**
```bash
"P:\DayZ Tools\Bin\AddonBuilder\AddonBuilder.exe" ^
    "P:\MyMod" ^
    "P:\output" ^
    -prefix="MyMod" ^
    -sign="P:\keys\MyKey"
```

### Command-Line Options

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-prefix=<path>` | Set the PBO internal prefix (critical for path resolution) |
| `-packonly` | Skip binarization, pack files as-is |
| `-sign=<key_path>` | Sign the PBO with the specified BI key (private key path, no extension) |
| `-include=<path>` | Include file list -- only pack files matching this filter |
| `-exclude=<path>` | Exclude file list -- skip files matching this filter |
| `-binarize=<path>` | Path to Binarize.exe (if not in default location) |
| `-temp=<path>` | Temporary directory for Binarize output |
| `-clear` | Clear output directory before packing |
| `-project=<path>` | Project drive path (usually `P:\`) |

---

## The -packonly Flag

The `-packonly` flag is one of the most important options in AddonBuilder. It tells the tool to skip all binarization and pack the source files exactly as they are.

### When to Use -packonly

| Mod Content | Use -packonly? | Reason |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Scripts only (.c files) | **Yes** | Scripts are never binarized |
| UI layouts (.layout) | **Yes** | Layouts are never binarized |
| Audio only (.ogg) | **Yes** | OGG is already game-ready |
| Pre-converted textures (.paa) | **Yes** | Already in final format |
| Config.cpp (no CfgVehicles) | **Yes** | Simple configs work unbinarized |
| Config.cpp (with CfgVehicles) | **No** | Item definitions require binarized config |
| P3D models (MLOD) | **No** | Should be binarized to ODOL for performance |
| TGA/PNG textures (need conversion) | **No** | Must be converted to PAA |

### Practical Guidance

For a **script-only mod** (like a framework or utility mod with no custom items):
```bash
AddonBuilder.exe "P:\MyScriptMod" "P:\output" -prefix="MyScriptMod" -packonly
```

For an **item mod** (weapons, clothing, vehicles with models and textures):
```bash
AddonBuilder.exe "P:\MyItemMod" "P:\output" -prefix="MyItemMod" -sign="P:\keys\MyKey"
```

> **Tip:** Many mods split into multiple PBOs precisely to optimize the build process. Script PBOs use `-packonly` (fast), while data PBOs with models and textures get full binarization (slower but necessary).

---

## The -prefix Flag

The `-prefix` flag sets the PBO's internal path prefix, which is written to the `$PBOPREFIX$` file inside the PBO. This prefix is critical -- it determines how the engine resolves paths to content inside the PBO.

### How Prefix Works

```
Source: P:\MyMod\data\textures\item_co.paa
Prefix: MyMod
PBO internal path: data\textures\item_co.paa

Engine resolution: MyMod\data\textures\item_co.paa
  --> Looks in MyMod.pbo for: data\textures\item_co.paa
  --> Found!
```

### Multi-Level Prefixes

For mods that use a subfolder structure, the prefix can include multiple levels:

```bash
# Source on P: drive
P:\MyMod\MyMod\Scripts\3_Game\MyClass.c

# If prefix is "MyMod\MyMod\Scripts"
# PBO internal: 3_Game\MyClass.c
# Engine path: MyMod\MyMod\Scripts\3_Game\MyClass.c
```

### Prefix Must Match References

If your config.cpp references `MyMod\data\texture_co.paa`, then the PBO containing that texture must have prefix `MyMod` and the file must be at `data\texture_co.paa` inside the PBO. A mismatch causes the engine to fail to find the file.

### Common Prefix Patterns

| Mod Structure | Source Path | Prefix | Config Reference |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-----------------|
| Simple mod | `P:\MyMod\` | `MyMod` | `MyMod\data\item.p3d` |
| Namespaced mod | `P:\MyMod_Weapons\` | `MyMod_Weapons` | `MyMod_Weapons\data\rifle.p3d` |
| Script sub-package | `P:\MyFramework\MyMod\Scripts\` | `MyFramework\MyMod\Scripts` | (referenced via config.cpp `CfgMods`) |

---

## Binarization: When Needed vs. Not

Binarization is the conversion of human-readable source formats into engine-optimized binary formats. It is the most time-consuming step in the build process and the most common source of build errors.

### What Gets Binarized

| File Type | Binarized To | Required? |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| `config.cpp` | `config.bin` | Required for mods defining items (CfgVehicles, CfgWeapons) |
| `.p3d` (MLOD) | `.p3d` (ODOL) | Recommended -- ODOL loads faster and is smaller |
| `.tga` / `.png` | `.paa` | Required -- engine needs PAA at runtime |
| `.edds` | `.paa` | Required -- same as above |
| `.rvmat` | `.rvmat` (processed) | Paths resolved, minor optimization |
| `.wrp` | `.wrp` (optimized) | Required for terrain/map mods |

### What is NOT Binarized

| File Type | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| `.c` scripts | Scripts are loaded as text by the engine |
| `.ogg` audio | Already in game-ready format |
| `.layout` files | Already in game-ready format |
| `.paa` textures | Already in final format (pre-converted) |
| `.json` data | Read as text by script code |

### Config.cpp Binarization Details

Config.cpp binarization is the step most modders encounter issues with. The binarizer parses the config.cpp text, validates its structure, resolves inheritance chains, and outputs a binary config.bin.

**When binarization is required for config.cpp:**
- The config defines `CfgVehicles` entries (items, weapons, vehicles, buildings).
- The config defines `CfgWeapons` entries.
- The config defines entries that reference models or textures.

**When binarization is NOT required:**
- The config only defines `CfgPatches` and `CfgMods` (mod registration).
- The config only defines sound configurations.
- Script-only mods with minimal config.

> **Rule of thumb:** If your config.cpp adds physical items to the game world, you need binarization. If it only registers scripts and defines non-item data, `-packonly` works fine.

---

## Key Signing

PBOs can be signed with a cryptographic key pair. Servers use signature verification to ensure all connected clients have the same (unmodified) mod files.

### Key Pair Components

| File | Extension | Purpose | Who Has It |
|------|-----------|---------|------------|
| Private key | `.biprivatekey` | Signs PBOs during build | Mod author only (KEEP SECRET) |
| Public key | `.bikey` | Verifies signatures | Server admins, distributed with mod |

### Generating Keys

Use DayZ Tools' **DSSignFile** or **DSCreateKey** utilities:

```bash
# Generate a key pair
DSCreateKey.exe MyModKey

# This creates:
#   MyModKey.biprivatekey   (keep secret, do not distribute)
#   MyModKey.bikey          (distribute to server admins)
```

### Signing During Build

```bash
AddonBuilder.exe "P:\MyMod" "P:\output" ^
    -prefix="MyMod" ^
    -sign="P:\keys\MyModKey"
```

This produces:
```
P:\output\
  MyMod.pbo
  MyMod.pbo.MyModKey.bisign    <-- Signature file
```

### Server-Side Key Installation

Server admins place the public key (`.bikey`) in the server's `keys/` directory:

```
DayZServer/
  keys/
    MyModKey.bikey             <-- Allows clients with this mod to connect
```

---

## @mod Folder Structure

DayZ expects mods to be organized in a specific directory structure using the `@` prefix convention:

```
@MyMod/
  addons/
    MyMod.pbo                  <-- Packed mod content
    MyMod.pbo.MyKey.bisign     <-- PBO signature (optional)
  keys/
    MyKey.bikey                <-- Public key for servers (optional)
  mod.cpp                      <-- Mod metadata
```

### mod.cpp

The `mod.cpp` file provides metadata displayed in the DayZ launcher:

```cpp
name = "My Awesome Mod";
author = "ModAuthor";
version = "1.0.0";
url = "https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=XXXXXXXXX";
```

### Multi-PBO Mods

Large mods often split into multiple PBOs within a single `@mod` folder:

```
@MyFramework/
  addons/
    MyMod_Core_Scripts.pbo        <-- Script layer
    MyMod_Core_Data.pbo           <-- Textures, models, materials
    MyMod_Core_GUI.pbo            <-- Layout files, imagesets
  keys/
    MyMod.bikey
  mod.cpp
```

### Loading Mods

Mods are loaded via the `-mod` parameter:

```bash
# Single mod
DayZDiag_x64.exe -mod="@MyMod"

# Multiple mods (semicolon-separated)
DayZDiag_x64.exe -mod="@MyFramework;@MyMod_Weapons;@MyMod_Missions"
```

The `@` folder must be in the game's root directory, or an absolute path must be provided.

---

## Automated Build Scripts

Manual PBO packing through AddonBuilder's GUI is acceptable for small, simple mods. For larger projects with multiple PBOs, automated build scripts are essential.

### Batch Script Pattern

A typical `build_pbos.bat`:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal

set TOOLS="P:\DayZ Tools\Bin\AddonBuilder\AddonBuilder.exe"
set OUTPUT="P:\@MyMod\addons"
set KEY="P:\keys\MyKey"

echo === Building Scripts PBO ===
%TOOLS% "P:\MyMod\Scripts" %OUTPUT% -prefix="MyMod\Scripts" -packonly -clear

echo === Building Data PBO ===
%TOOLS% "P:\MyMod\Data" %OUTPUT% -prefix="MyMod\Data" -sign=%KEY% -clear

echo === Build Complete ===
pause
```

### Python Build Script Pattern (dev.py)

For more sophisticated builds, a Python script provides better error handling, logging, and conditional logic:

```python
import subprocess
import os
import sys

ADDON_BUILDER = r"P:\DayZ Tools\Bin\AddonBuilder\AddonBuilder.exe"
OUTPUT_DIR = r"P:\@MyMod\addons"
KEY_PATH = r"P:\keys\MyKey"

PBOS = [
    {
        "name": "Scripts",
        "source": r"P:\MyMod\Scripts",
        "prefix": r"MyMod\Scripts",
        "packonly": True,
    },
    {
        "name": "Data",
        "source": r"P:\MyMod\Data",
        "prefix": r"MyMod\Data",
        "packonly": False,
    },
]

def build_pbo(pbo_config):
    """Build a single PBO."""
    cmd = [
        ADDON_BUILDER,
        pbo_config["source"],
        OUTPUT_DIR,
        f"-prefix={pbo_config['prefix']}",
    ]

    if pbo_config.get("packonly"):
        cmd.append("-packonly")
    else:
        cmd.append(f"-sign={KEY_PATH}")

    print(f"Building {pbo_config['name']}...")
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True)

    if result.returncode != 0:
        print(f"ERROR building {pbo_config['name']}:")
        print(result.stderr)
        return False

    print(f"  {pbo_config['name']} built successfully.")
    return True

def main():
    os.makedirs(OUTPUT_DIR, exist_ok=True)

    success = True
    for pbo in PBOS:
        if not build_pbo(pbo):
            success = False

    if success:
        print("\nAll PBOs built successfully.")
    else:
        print("\nBuild completed with errors.")
        sys.exit(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Integration with dev.py

The MyMod project uses `dev.py` as the central build orchestrator:

```bash
python dev.py build          # Build all PBOs
python dev.py server         # Build + launch server + monitor logs
python dev.py full           # Build + server + client
```

This pattern is recommended for any multi-mod workspace. A single command builds everything, launches the server, and starts monitoring -- eliminating manual steps and reducing human error.

---

## Multi-PBO Mod Builds

Large mods benefit from splitting into multiple PBOs. This has several advantages:

### Why Split into Multiple PBOs

1. **Faster rebuilds.** If you change only a script, rebuild only the script PBO (with `-packonly`, which takes seconds). The data PBO (with binarization) takes minutes and does not need rebuilding.
2. **Modular loading.** Server-only PBOs can be excluded from client downloads.
3. **Cleaner organization.** Scripts, data, and GUI are clearly separated.
4. **Parallel builds.** Independent PBOs can be built simultaneously.

### Typical Split Pattern

```
@MyMod/
  addons/
    MyMod_Core.pbo           <-- config.cpp, CfgPatches (binarized)
    MyMod_Scripts.pbo         <-- All .c script files (-packonly)
    MyMod_Data.pbo            <-- Models, textures, materials (binarized)
    MyMod_GUI.pbo             <-- Layouts, imagesets (-packonly)
    MyMod_Sounds.pbo          <-- OGG audio files (-packonly)
```

### Dependency Between PBOs

When one PBO depends on another (e.g., scripts reference items defined in the config PBO), the `requiredAddons[]` in `CfgPatches` ensures correct load order:

```cpp
// In MyMod_Scripts config.cpp
class CfgPatches
{
    class MyMod_Scripts
    {
        requiredAddons[] = {"MyMod_Core"};   // Load after the core PBO
    };
};
```

---

## Common Build Errors and Solutions

### Error: "Include file not found"

**Cause:** Config.cpp references a file (model, texture) that does not exist at the expected path.
**Solution:** Verify the file exists on P: at the exact path referenced. Check spelling and capitalization.

### Error: "Binarize failed" with no details

**Cause:** Binarize crashed on a corrupted or invalid source file.
**Solution:**
1. Check which file Binarize was processing (look at its log output).
2. Open the problematic file in the appropriate tool (Object Builder for P3D, TexView2 for textures).
3. Validate the file.
4. Common culprits: non-power-of-2 textures, corrupted P3D files, invalid config.cpp syntax.

### Error: "Addon requires addon X"

**Cause:** CfgPatches `requiredAddons[]` lists an addon that is not present.
**Solution:** Either install the required addon, add it to the build, or remove the requirement if it is not actually needed.

### Error: Config.cpp parse error (line X)

**Cause:** Syntax error in config.cpp.
**Solution:** Open config.cpp in a text editor and check line X. Common issues:
- Missing semicolons after class definitions.
- Unclosed braces `{}`.
- Missing quotes around string values.
- Backslash at end of line (line continuation is not supported).

### Error: PBO prefix mismatch

**Cause:** The prefix in the PBO does not match the paths used in config.cpp or materials.
**Solution:** Ensure `-prefix` matches the path structure expected by all references. If config.cpp references `MyMod\data\item.p3d`, the PBO prefix must be `MyMod` and the file must be at `data\item.p3d` inside the PBO.

### Error: "Signature check failed" on server

**Cause:** Client's PBO does not match the server's expected signature.
**Solution:**
1. Ensure both server and client have the same PBO version.
2. Re-sign the PBO with a fresh key if needed.
3. Update the `.bikey` on the server.

### Error: "Cannot open file" during Binarize

**Cause:** P: drive is not mounted or the file path is incorrect.
**Solution:** Mount P: drive and verify the source path exists.

## Testing: File Patching vs. PBO Loading

Development involves two testing modes. Choosing the right one for each situation saves significant time.

### File Patching (Development)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Speed** | Instant -- edit file, restart game |
| **Setup** | Mount P: drive, launch with `-filePatching` flag |
| **Executable** | `DayZDiag_x64.exe` (Diag build required) |
| **Signing** | Not applicable (no PBOs to sign) |
| **Limitations** | No binarized configs, Diag build only |
| **Best for** | Script development, UI iteration, rapid prototyping |

### PBO Loading (Release Testing)

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Speed** | Slower -- must rebuild PBO for each change |
| **Setup** | Build PBO, place in `@mod/addons/` |
| **Executable** | `DayZDiag_x64.exe` or retail `DayZ_x64.exe` |
| **Signing** | Supported (required for multiplayer) |
| **Limitations** | Rebuild required for every change |
| **Best for** | Final testing, multiplayer testing, release validation |

### Recommended Workflow

1. **Develop with file patching:** Write scripts, adjust layouts, iterate on textures. Restart the game to test. No build step.
2. **Build PBOs periodically:** Test the binarized build to catch binarization-specific issues (config parse errors, texture conversion problems).
3. **Final test with PBO only:** Before release, test exclusively from PBOs to ensure the packed mod works identically to the file-patched version.
4. **Sign and distribute PBOs:** Generate signatures for multiplayer compatibility.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Use `-packonly` for script PBOs.** Scripts are never binarized, so `-packonly` is always correct and much faster.

2. **Always set a prefix.** Without a prefix, the engine cannot resolve paths to your mod's content. Every PBO must have a correct `-prefix`.

3. **Automate your builds.** Create a build script (batch or Python) from day one. Manual packing does not scale and is error-prone.

4. **Keep source and output separate.** Source on P:, built PBOs in a separate output directory or `@mod/addons/`. Never pack from the output directory.

5. **Sign your PBOs for any multiplayer testing.** Unsigned PBOs are rejected by servers with signature verification enabled. Sign during development even if it seems unnecessary -- it prevents "works for me" issues when others test.

6. **Version your keys.** When you make breaking changes, generate a new key pair. This forces all clients and servers to update together.

7. **Test both file patching and PBO modes.** Some bugs only appear in one mode. Binarized configs behave differently from text configs in edge cases.

8. **Clean your output directory regularly.** Stale PBOs from previous builds can cause confusing behavior. Use the `-clear` flag or manually clean before building.

9. **Split large mods into multiple PBOs.** The time saved on incremental rebuilds pays for itself within the first day of development.

10. **Read the build logs.** Binarize and AddonBuilder produce log files. When something goes wrong, the answer is almost always in the logs. Check `%TEMP%\AddonBuilder\` and `%TEMP%\Binarize\` for detailed output.

---

## Observed in Real Mods

| Pattern | Mod | Detail |
|---------|-----|--------|
| 20+ PBOs per mod with fine-grained splits | Expansion (all modules) | Splits into separate PBOs for Scripts, Data, GUI, Vehicles, Book, Market, etc., enabling independent rebuilds and optional client/server separation |
| Scripts/Data/GUI triple-split | StarDZ (Core, Missions, AI) | Each mod produces 2-3 PBOs: `_Scripts.pbo` (packonly), `_Data.pbo` (binarized models/textures), `_GUI.pbo` (packonly layouts) |
| Single monolithic PBO | Simple retexture mods | Small mods with only a config.cpp and a few PAA textures pack everything into one PBO with binarization |
| Key versioning per major release | Expansion | Generates new key pairs for breaking updates, forcing all clients and servers to update in sync |

---

## Compatibility & Impact

- **Multi-Mod:** PBO prefix collisions cause the engine to load one mod's files instead of another's. Every mod must use a unique prefix. Check `$PBOPREFIX$` carefully when debugging "file not found" errors in multi-mod environments.
- **Performance:** PBO loading is fast (sequential file reads), but mods with many large PBOs increase server startup time. Binarized content loads faster than unbinarized. Use ODOL models and PAA textures for release builds.
- **Version:** The PBO format itself has not changed. AddonBuilder receives periodic fixes via DayZ Tools updates, but the command-line flags and packing behavior have been stable since DayZ 1.0.
